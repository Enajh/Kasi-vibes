				<h2>Our history </h2>
					<p>We started at 2005 November 25. We started with 5 employees till now, we have been providing people with the best jewellery ever. </p>
					<P>At the age of 18, Arthur Norman Kaplan (1928-1997) entered the family business, a jewellery store which his grandfather, Henry Balzham, established in Pretoria in 1889. It seems that Arthur was destined to inherit a passion for jewellery, one which stemmed all the way back from his great uncle, who was known to be the personal jeweller of Paul Kruger. After 15 years of learning the family business, Arthur Kaplan decided to open his own jewellery store. In 1973, he opened the first store in Pretoria and the Arthur Kaplan brand was born.

Over time Arthur Kaplan expanded the stores across South Africa. With the support of family employed in the business, Arthur quickly earned a reputation for personal service that has since become synonymous with the name. The Arthur Kaplan brand soon became renowned as a trusted destination for diamond engagement rings.

After 50 years in the business that he loved, and with a successful JSE listing behind him, Arthur Kaplan retired and sold the company that bears his name. The management team at Arthur Kaplan purchased the business in 2001 and steadfastly built the brand’s reputation for luxury merchandise. In 2014, the business was acquired by Taste Holdings, a JSE listed group who share the vision and passion of the Arthur Kaplan team.</P>
				<H2>Our Mission</H2>
				<p>Our mission is to sell good quality jewellery to our customers and we promise not to sell fake jewellery. </p>
				<p>We have a strong bond with well known companies like <b>Rolex</b>, <b>Tag heuer</b>, <b>Casio</b> And etc. </p>
				<p>This success was followed by the launch of our bespoke Jewellery Engagement Collections. The engagement rings in this collection are a culmination of years of development with our clients and reflect on our heritage of timeless design, quality and exquisite attention to detail.

The release of our Engagement Collections inspired ideas for new jewellery pieces, and from 2010 a bouquet of exclusive diamond collections was developed. Each collection was created to celebrate an aspect of your life’s journey or to evoke and reflect a beautiful emotion.</p>
				<H2>Our Vision</H2>
